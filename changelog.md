### What's New in v2
This release, API version 2, introduces several new APIs.
Changes with the potential to break existing scripts:
* Changes to the `install-policy` command:
* install-policy will check if the currently installed policy matches the policy in the request.
* This check can be skipped with the `ignore-warnings` parameter.
* Changes to the `set-package` command:
* If the `installation-targets` field is emptied via the `remove` value, the list will remain empty rather than automatically set to "All" Gateways
* The `https-layer` field in the request and the `https-inspection-layer` in the reply have been replaced with `https-inspection-layers`.
* Changes to the `delete-package` command:
* delete-package will check if the policy is currently installed on any gateway before it is deleted.
* This check can be skipped with the `ignore-warnings` parameter.
